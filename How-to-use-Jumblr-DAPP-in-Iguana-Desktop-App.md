### What is Jumblr?
- Jumblr is Komodo based fully decentralized anonymizer utilizing native DEX
- You can use Jumblr to make your BTC and KMD funds sitting in public address mix with Jumblr and get the funds to another public but anonymous address removing any tracks of funds shuffled in the process.


### Few Security Notes for your Privacy and Anonymity of funds:
- Jumblr addresses (BTC Jumbler and KMD Jumbler) addresses are your Private Addresses.
- DO NOT SHARE your Jumblr addresses with anyone.
- Jumblr addresses are like YOUR PASSWORD. Keep them safe, secure and hidden.
- Only YOU should know your Jumblr Address. Nobody else.
- Sharing your Jumblr Addresses with ANYONE will defeat the purpose of using Jumblr, and your funds and transactions will not be private anymore.



### How to Access your Jumblr Funds:
Your Jumbler Addresses are accessible easily.
For example you logged into your wallet with passphrase

```
duck dog cat donkey
```

1. To access your Jumbler address funds Logout.
2. Close Iguana App.
3. Start Iguana App again.
4. Start Komodo in either Full Mode or Basilisk Mode.
5. Then add word 'jumblr ' before your passphrase.

	- "jumblr" is all in small letters.
	- There is a white space after "jumblr ".

6. So as per this example, your Jumbler Addresses are accessible with:

```
jumblr duck dog cat donkey
```

7. You'll login with your Jumblr passphrase to access funds and will be able to use it just like any other wallet address.


Again, DO NOT SHARE YOUR JUMBLR ADDRESS WITH ANYONE.



### Using Jumblr:
- Run Komodo in Native Mode
- Loging with your passphrase
- Go to Jumblr Menu
- There find your Deposit Address for coin you want to anonymise your funds. (For a start only KMD is supported. BTC support will come in later versions)
- You send your funds to deposit address.
- Keep your wallet open
- [IMPORTANT] Funds are processed in lot sizes 100 KMD, 1000 KMD, and 10,000 KMD.
- The large lot sizes will process first, and then smaller.

For example, you sent 1393 KMD to KMD Deposit Address.
First it will process 1000 KMD
then 100 KMD
then 100 KMD
then 100 KMD

93 KMD will keep waiting in deposit address.

To clear them you'll have to send 7 KMD more to your KMD Deposit Address.

When it totals to 100 KMD, it will process to your KMD Jumblr Address.
